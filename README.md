# London Bike Rides

Kaggle [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset) for dataset.

##Problem Statement
Goal of this project: Visualize demand for bikes given different weather, temperature conditions, seasonality and other temporal conditions in Python and then use Tableau to visualize data.

##Understand the metadata
The columns in the dataset aren't very descriptive and so below is a breakdown for the metadata:

1. "timestamp" - timestamp field for grouping the data
2. "cnt" - the count of a new bike shares
3. "t1" - real temperature in C
4. "t2" - temperature in C "feels like"
5. "hum" - humidity in percentage
6. "wind_speed" - wind speed in km/h
7. "weather_code" - category of the weather : 1 = Clear ; mostly clear but have some values with haze/fog/patches of fog/ fog in vicinity 2 = scattered clouds / few clouds 3 = Broken clouds 4 = Cloudy 7 = Rain/ light Rain shower/ Light rain 10 = rain with thunderstorm 26 = snowfall 94 = Freezing Fog
8. "is_holiday" - boolean field - 1 holiday / 0 non holiday
9. "is_weekend" - boolean field - 1 if the day is weekend
10. "season" - category field meteorological seasons: 0-spring ; 1-summer; 2-fall; 3-winter.
